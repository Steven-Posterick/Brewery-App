# Brewery Application

This program will prompt the user for the inputs of malts (name, potential,
efficiency, and grain weight) and the inputs of hops (name, alpha acids, 
weight, and time).  

Program Description: The app will scale up a 5 gallon recipe to a 10 bbl 
recipe, then calculate the ABV and IBU of the beer recipe. 

Inputs:
Malts:
Name = name of the malt (for display purposes)
Potential = the potential of the malt
Efficiency = the efficiency of the malt in percent
Weight = weight of malts in pounds. 

Optional inputs:
Batch size = the final volume of the batch in gallons 
Pre boil size = The volume of the water before boiling in gallons
Scaled Batch Size = The volume of the scaled up batch size in gallons
Yeast efficiency = the efficiency of your yeast typically 67%-80% 

Hops: 
Name = name of hops (for display purposes)
AA = Alpha Acids
Weight = the weight of the hops added in ounces
Time = time the hops will be added in minutes 

Output: 
ABV = alcohol percent per volume
IBU = Units of IBU for the brew
